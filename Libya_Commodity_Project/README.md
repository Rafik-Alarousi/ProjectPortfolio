## üí¨ Project Information:

<br/>

 <h3>

This is a data analytics project based on Libya Commodities Dataset from The [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wfp-food-prices-for-libya). We wanted to sample the dataset, which included 46,683 rows, so we imported it into Excel Sheets and sampled the data based on the average of each region. Before we launched the study, we checked the sample size data to ensure that it accurately represented each location. After cleaning and analyzing the data, we imported it into MySQL for additional querying and analysis utilizing SQL's most powerful features. Finally, before completing the project, we exported the clean dataset to [Tableau for Visualizations](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rafik.arousi/viz/LibyaCommodityProject/Dashboard).
